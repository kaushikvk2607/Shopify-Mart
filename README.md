# 🛒 Shopify Mart – AI Powered E-Commerce Platform

Shopify Mart is a **full-stack AI-powered e-commerce platform** that integrates a **conversational product discovery chatbot** into the shopping experience.  
Instead of traditional keyword search, users can ask natural language queries and receive **AI-generated personalized product recommendations**.

Example query:

> "I am a student and need headphones under ₹1500 for 4 hours of daily study."

The system uses **semantic search with embeddings and FAISS vector similarity** to retrieve relevant products and generate context-aware responses using a **Large Language Model (LLaMA)**.

# 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Registration
1. User submits email, username and password  
2. Password hashed using bcrypt  
3. Stored securely in MongoDB  

### Login
1. Email and password verified  
2. JWT access token generated  
3. Token stored in HTTP-only cookies  

### Protected Routes
Middleware verifies JWT token before granting access.

# 📊 Performance Optimizations

Implemented several system-level optimizations:

- Lazy loading of LLM and FAISS index
- Reduced maximum token generation
- Vector indexing for faster retrieval
- Stateless JWT authentication
- Efficient React state management

---

# 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

### Problem: Slow chatbot startup
Cause: Large model and FAISS index loading.

Solution: Implemented **lazy loading** so models load only on first request.

---

### Problem: LLM hallucination
Cause: LLM generating responses without context.

Solution: Implemented **strict RAG pipeline with top-k retrieval**.

---

### Problem: Deployment limitations
Cause: Large LLaMA model required high memory.

Solution: Separated chatbot as **independent microservice**.

---

# 📈 Future Improvements

- Deploy chatbot on GPU instance
- Add product recommendation ranking
- Implement caching layer for embeddings
- Integrate payment gateway
- Add user review system
